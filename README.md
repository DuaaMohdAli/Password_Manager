# Password Manager
  This is a small web app I built using Python and Flask. It lets you save website passwords — just the site name, username, and password — and shows them on the page. No login, no database, just quick and easy.4
# Tech Used
  Python + Flask (backend)
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)
  Everything is stored in memory (so it resets when you restart)
